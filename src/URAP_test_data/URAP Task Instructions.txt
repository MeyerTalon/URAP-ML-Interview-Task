Please open the zipped data folder. It contains the following files:

a) companies.txt
A text file that contains 100,000 company name examples

b) locations.tsv
A tab-separated (“\t”) text file that contains locations
Column 1: Location name
Column 2: Location type (‘country’, ‘state’, ‘city’)

c) legal.txt
A text file that contains some legal (company) entity forms/identifiers, like ltd., corp, GmbH, etc.

Task 1)

Please write a Python class NameComponents, that has a method:
get_name_components(self, comp_name)
get_name_components takes one argument, “comp_name”, which is one company name String.
It returns a dictionary of the input String and its name components.

Example 1: 
comp_name = “Cognism (Germany) Ldt.”
return_value = {“raw”: “Cognism (Germany) Ldt.”, “base_name”: “cognism”, location: ‘germany’, legal: ‘ldt.’ }

Example 2: 
comp_name = “Cognism Limited United Kingdom”
return_value = {“raw”: “Cognism Limited United Kingdom”, “base_name”: “cognism”, location: ‘united kingdom’, legal: ‘limited’ }

Example 3:
comp_name = “Cognism”
return_value = {“raw”: “Cognism”, “base_name”: “cognism”}

Task 2 (optional)

Let’s say, we also want to predict, if and where comp_name contains a legal identifier, no matter if it is contained in c) legal.tsv or not. 
Either describe your suggested approach in text form, or write actual code to extend the functionality of NameComponents to also achieve this task.
If you have attempted to solve the task with code, but didn’t manage to run it successfully, it is no problem to send your attempt with unfinished code.
